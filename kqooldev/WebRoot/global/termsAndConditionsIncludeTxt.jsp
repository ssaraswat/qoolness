Refund Policy
Kqool.comTM aims to provide high quality automated documents to the public at a cost that is lower or equal to most 'fill in the blank' online training and fitness websites.

Given the above facts and the fact that there is an accounting overhead with each order and there would be a further accounting overhead to manually refund any sale, Kqool.comTM has had to make it a general policy to not refund any sales except in extraordinary circumstances.
